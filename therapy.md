<h2>Therapy</h2>
<hr>

<p>Therapy is my first love in the healing and helping professions. I received a bachelor's degree from Creighton University in psychology. I continued to earn a Masters in Social Work at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I am currently an independently licensed therapist in the state of Iowa and Nebraska. I am certified master social worker (CMSW) I am also a licensed independent clinical social worker (LICSW/LISW).  I enjoy working with individuals, families, couples, and groups. I consider myself to be a client centered therapist and find it important to meet my clients where they are in their lives. My mission as a provider is to empower my clients to find their own inner strength. I have several years of experience working in the mental health field treating individuals with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem/self image, relationship and marital conflict, life adjustments and transitions, and grief and loss.</p>

<p>I specialize in trauma, and I facilitate EMDR. Other therapeutic modalities include, but are not limited to Sand Tray therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Strength Based, Circle of Security, and Structural Family Therapy. I am also trained in Seeking Safety, a group for women who have been affected by domestic violence and substance abuse.</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy yoga and meditation, Jazzercise, creative and artistic activities, and spending time with my family and friends.
I would recommend therapeutic services for those who need a higher level of care as they explore their past trauma. Please feel free to contact me if you are unsure if you would be best served by my therapeutic services.</p>
