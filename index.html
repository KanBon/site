    <h2>Welcome Friends!</h2>
  	<p>My name is Kani Rubango I am a therapist, life coach, and spiritual healer. I am a practicing mental health therapist in the state of Iowa and Nebraska. I have an educational back ground in psychology and social work.  As I have told my clients in the past I like to consider myself to be a client centered provider. As a professional I think it is imperative to look at the person in their environment and create a unique plan that will best suit their personal goals and value system. This is why I believe in the concept of treating the whole person from multiple perspectives. My goal is to meet you were you are in your personal healing journey, and help you become the best version of yourself.</p>
