<h2>Life Coaching</h2>
<hr>
<p>"Life is about trusting the mess. Our mess tells our story, and helps create our purpose and message. " - Kani</p>

<p>As a practicing client centered therapist, I feel, at times, growth is limited by traditional therapeutic modalities. Thus, I decided to branch out to life coaching in order to implement more non-traditional techniques that are client-centered.  Over the past few years, I have explored various forms of healing and enjoyed taking a very open approach to helping others accomplish their goals.  As a coach I use strengths based mindset to empower others to trust their gifts and authentically grow in purpose. My goal is to inspire others to recognize their mess, overcome barriers, and stand victorious in their life purpose.</p>

<p>I am also a clinical therapist who specializes in trauma. In my spare time, I enjoy yoga and meditation, spending time with family and friends, and trying new experiences. I love to lead boldly and authentically with my vibrant personality. I coach with warmth. However, I think that it is important to keep things real. I believe that circumstances are not always fair in life. Thus, it is important that we acknowledge and honor our challenges, traumas, and other limiting experiences.  In order to be successful, we must take the lessons we learned from these experiences.  I believe that we have the power to manifest our future.  My hope is to work with individuals who are ready to make changes towards a life that is healthy, happy, and whole.  So, if you are ready to go deep, unpack your mess, change your perspective, and level up,  I am the coach for you!</p>
